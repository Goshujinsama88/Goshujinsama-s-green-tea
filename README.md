Goshujinsama's green tea is a theme for Cinnamon desktop manager, is **based in the Cinnamon**
**theme from Matcha GTK theme by vinceliuice**. This theme is aimmed to Linux Mint, so includes
a modification of the GTK Theme for Nemo and other programs to match the Cinnamon Theme.

[**Matcha GTK theme by vinceliuice:**](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme)

**Note:** This theme doesn't recieve any support from vinceliuice or the Matcha GTK Theme team.
This theme was done modifiyng the css files directly, so I think maybe this will be the
only release that I work that way. In future I like to work as the HACKING file in Matcha GTK
theme says, but maybe that modification will be in another repository.
